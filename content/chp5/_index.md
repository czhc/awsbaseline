# Disaster Recovery

The Octank marketplace is alive and hitting 100 MAUs and they are no longer recording order placements on paper!

Their data in production is new important and they cannot afford losing customers for a few hours like they used to. Help them understand what is disaster recovery, and how to prepare themselves for the unlikely event of failure.
